AI Travel Co-Pilot â€” UI/UX Design Guide
Version: 1.0
Goal: To create a beautiful, intuitive, and emotionally resonant user experience that feels more like a companion than a tool.

1. Design Philosophy
Conversational First: The chat interface is the core of the app. All interactions should feel as natural as texting a friend.

Clean & Uncluttered: We will use ample white space, a limited color palette, and clear typography to create a calm, focused experience, reducing the typical stress of travel planning.

Delightful Micro-interactions: Small, polished animations and haptic feedback will be used to make the app feel alive and responsive.

2. Brand & Visual Identity
2.1. Color Palette
The palette is inspired by the sky, from a clear day to a warm sunset, creating a sense of calm and possibility.

Primary Blue: #007AFF (A friendly, accessible blue for primary actions and AI chat bubbles).

Accent Coral: #FF8C69 (A warm, energetic color for notifications, alerts, and key highlights).

Background Gradient: A subtle, top-to-bottom linear gradient from #F0F8FF (AliceBlue) to #FFFFFF (White) to give the app an airy feel.

Text & Neutrals: Dark Gray (#333333) for text, Light Gray (#EFEFF4) for UI elements like the input bar.

2.2. Typography
Font: SF Pro Display (Apple's native font) will be used for its excellent readability and modern feel.

Hierarchy:

Headings: SF Pro Bold, 24pt

Body/Chat: SF Pro Regular, 17pt

Subtext: SF Pro Light, 15pt

2.3. Iconography
A set of custom, lightweight, line-art icons will be used. They should be friendly and instantly recognizable.

Key Icons: Airplane (for flights), Bell (for alerts), Dashboard (grid), Settings (gear), Microphone.

3. Screen Mockup Descriptions
3.1. Onboarding
A three-screen horizontal carousel that introduces the app's value. Each screen has a simple illustration and minimal text.

Screen 1: Illustration of a person speaking into a phone. Header: "Talk, Don't Type." Body: "Simply tell your Co-Pilot what you're looking for."

Screen 2: Illustration of a notification bell with a price tag. Header: "Never Miss a Deal." Body: "We'll watch the prices and alert you when they drop."

Screen 3: A "Sign in with Google" button is prominently displayed.

3.2. Main Chat View
This is the home screen and primary point of interaction.

The background has the subtle sky gradient.

User Chat Bubbles: Right-aligned, solid Primary Blue (#007AFF) with white text.

AI Chat Bubbles: Left-aligned, light gray (#EFEFF4) with dark gray text. The AI's avatar is a simple, friendly paper airplane logo.

Input Bar: A clean, rounded rectangle at the bottom. It contains a text input field ("Ask me anything...") and a microphone icon. Tapping the microphone initiates listening, and the icon transforms into a pulsating sound wave animation.

3.3. Dashboard View
Accessible via an icon in the top navigation bar.

Layout: A clean, vertical list of "Trip Cards."

Trip Card: Each card is a rounded rectangle with a light shadow. It displays:

The route in large, bold text (e.g., SFO â†’ SBA).

The dates below the route.

The current lowest price, highlighted in the Accent Coral color.

A small, subtle "tracking active" icon (e.g., the bell).

3.4. Push Notification
The notification is designed to be instantly informative and actionable.
